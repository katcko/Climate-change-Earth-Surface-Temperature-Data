# Climate-change-Earth-Surface-Temperature-Data
Exploring earth surface temperature data using ARIMA mode

The main purpose of this project is to explore the opensource data available at https://berkeleyearth.org/data/. 
Firtly we explore the eatch temperature trends and secondly we use both ARIMA and SARIMA models to forecast the time series data.
The goal of the project it to forecast earth surface temperatures in the 21th century using the historic data available.
